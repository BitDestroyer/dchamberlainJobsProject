install and run directions:
pystests should be independantly runnable test, to run the independant test right click on the individual tests with function
names starting with the word "test_" to run tests. You will need pytest installed! For anything else you can just run the file!

The project I made is designed to retrieve data from a github webpage using and breaking up the retrieved data, and storing it 
onto a file for review.

Given more time I would have liked to restructure these into two seperate classes, one class is of the file generator with the 
data extractor with the other class is simply for testing, I think keeping the tests for something this small of a program
will make it easier to read.
