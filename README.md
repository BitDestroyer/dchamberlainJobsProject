install and run directions:
pystests should be independantly runnable test, to run the independant test right click on the individual tests with function
names starting with the word "test_" to run tests. You will need pytest installed! For anything else you can just run the file!

The project I made is designed to retrieve data from a github webpage using and breaking up the retrieved data, and storing it 
onto a file for review. However due to over whelming pull requests from the site, there is an issue with no http response.
So the program may not run, but it will tell you what pages (if any) the program reaches.

Given more time I would have liked to restructure these into two seperate classes, one class is of the file generator with the 
data extractor with the other class is simply for testing, I think keeping the tests for something this small of a program
will make it easier to read.
